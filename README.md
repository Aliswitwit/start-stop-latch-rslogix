# Start/Stop Latching Motor â€“ RSLogix 500

This PLC project demonstrates a basic Start/Stop motor circuit using ladder logic and a software latch. The motor stays energized after the Start button is released and turns OFF only when the Stop button is pressed.

## ðŸ§  How it works:
- `I:0/0`: Start Button (Normally Open)
- `I:0/1`: Stop Button (Normally Closed)
- `B3:0/0`: Internal latch bit
- `O:0/0`: Motor output

## ðŸ”§ Ladder Logic:

### ðŸ“¸ Resting State
> This is the initial state of the logic. Neither the Start nor Stop buttons are pressed. The internal memory bit `B3:0/0` is OFF, and the motor output `O:0/0` is de-energized.

### ðŸ“¸ Start Button Pressed
> The Start button (`I:0/0`) has been pressed, initiating the motor control logic. The rung conditions are true, and the internal memory bit `B3:0/0` is energized via the latch logic.

### ðŸ“¸ Latch Maintained
> The Start button has been released, but the seal-in path keeps the internal memory bit `B3:0/0` latched. This maintains power to the motor (`O:0/0`).

### ðŸ“¸ Stop Button Pressed
> The Stop button (`I:0/1`) has been pressed, breaking the rung and resetting the latch. The internal bit `B3:0/0` is now de-energized, and the motor (`O:0/0`) is OFF.
